// This demo illustrates the use of raycast filtering. 
// On one side of the demo, the ray cast hits only objects of the same
// collision layer (indicated by the same color as the ray).
// On the other side, the ray is shot against a hkpMeshShape, 
// where it only hits selected triangles.
// This selection of triangles is archived by adding material
// information to the mesh, which includes also collision filter
// data.
